# README – Letter to the European Commission 

##  Overview
This document is a formal letter concerning the **road construction project in Kętrzyn, Poland**, which was found to be **inconsistent with EU guidelines** regarding the removal of transit traffic from urban centers.  

The case highlights issues of **policy misalignment, ignored expert recommendations, and civic opposition**, and was submitted to the European Commission under reference **CHAP(2013)03948**.

---

##  Objective
To evaluate the compliance of the proposed infrastructure project with **EU sustainable transport guidelines** and to advocate for alternative solutions—specifically, a **ring road bypass**—to mitigate environmental and social impact.

---

##  Summary of Findings
1. **Policy Misalignment**  
   - The Polish Ministry of Infrastructure and Development claimed EU transport communications are non-binding.  
   - This interpretation undermines the intent of EU directives such as:  
     - *Greening Transport* (COM(2008) 433 final)  
     - *Sustainable Future of Transportation* (COM(2009) 279 final)  
     - *EU Sustainable Development Strategy Review* (COM(2009) 400 final)  

2. **Expert Recommendations Ignored**  
   - A study by Prof. Jan Burniewicz (University of Gdańsk), co-financed by the ERDF, recommended:  
     - Prioritizing ring roads and tunnels to divert transit traffic.  
     - Avoiding small roundabouts and traffic islands, which increase congestion and pollution.  
     - Designing infrastructure with long-term macroeconomic, environmental, and social considerations.  

3. **Civic Opposition**  
   - Local residents petitioned against the project, citing risks to historical architecture, increased traffic, and environmental degradation.  
   - The community demanded funds be reallocated to a **ring road bypassing Kętrzyn**.
